# CVE-2025-59250 - Microsoft SQL Server JDBC Driver
# Status: FALSE POSITIVE
#
# Description:
# Trivy flags mssql-jdbc 12.10.2.jre8 as vulnerable to CVE-2025-59250, but this
# version actually CONTAINS THE FIX for this vulnerability.
#
# Evidence:
# - Liquibase Secure 5.0.2 upgraded mssql-jdbc from 12.10.1.jre8 to 12.10.2.jre8
# - This upgrade explicitly addressed CVE-2025-59250 (see DAT-21214)
# - Microsoft released mssql-jdbc 12.10.2.jre8 on October 13, 2024 as a security update
# - The vulnerability affects versions <12.10.2.jre8
# - Version 12.10.2.jre8 contains the fix
#
# Root Cause of False Positive:
# Trivy's vulnerability database only lists JRE11 variants as fixed versions:
# (10.2.4.jre11, 11.2.4.jre11, 12.2.1.jre11, 12.6.5.jre11, 12.8.2.jre11,
#  12.10.2.jre11, 13.2.1.jre11)
# The database doesn't recognize that the JRE8 variant (12.10.2.jre8) is also patched.
